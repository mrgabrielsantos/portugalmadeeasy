<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably don&#8217;t give much thought to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity &#8211; just that they&#8217;re chipping away at your battery life.</p>



<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignwide is-style-default"><blockquote><p><strong>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don&#8217;t want to overwhelm them with terrible advice. Best to keep them on track.</strong></p><cite>JOHN MCCARTHY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1-2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that&#8217;s opaque, because we can&#8217;t see it directly.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, crushing it, changing the world.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Take a social media hiatus.</strong>&nbsp;According to a recent survey from Everyday Health, 60 to 70 percent of young adults say they check their social media platforms at least daily. Why not dial that back for the holidays?</li>



<li><strong>Stick to your new routine.</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s tempting to shake up your typical schedule when the holidays come around, but women&#8217;s health expert and BINTO founder Suzie Welsh emphasizes the importance of routine amid the revelry.</li>



<li><strong>Be intentional about fitness.</strong>&nbsp;If working out is a de-stressor for you 365 days of the year, you want to make it a priority, no matter how crazy the holiday season gets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. There is always the New Project, the New Opportunity.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8388" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-150x100.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-450x300.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An awesome day for working remotely.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though Google and Facebook opened Australian offices relatively early (Google in 2003 and Facebook in 2009), they are unashamedly <a href="#">US companies</a>, obsessed with US politics. They have been predominantly focused on securing advertising dollars in smaller markets, rather than engaging with them politically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear their threats are attempts to now get the attention of Australia&#8217;s political class. And if the platforms follow through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. To be successful, follow your passion and see where it leads you. All you have to do is jump right in!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8401" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-150x100.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-450x299.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Beach resorts office might be the final destination.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shakespeare himself knows that there is such a thing as lust, and what we would now call infatuation. He&#8217;s no fool. People who exhibit the perfectionism are fearful of failure.</p>



<p>Google and Facebook were comparatively passive when the draft code first emerged in 2019, as part of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#8217;s Digital Platforms Inquiry. Providing advance notice of any changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>



<p>Success isn&#8217;t about the end result, it&#8217;s about what you learn along the way. There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the <a href="#">Critics&#8217; Choice Awards</a> and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. The contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Light comes from all sorts of randomness void.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>



<li>Smart phones are a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;energy drain.</li>



<li>Buy&nbsp;<strong>SmartMag</strong>&nbsp;for your successful site.</li>
</ul>



<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea, the quicker it gets executed and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer.&nbsp;Add your email&nbsp;address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for:</strong> Students, people who need only basic features, and anyone who wants a cheap laptop to use as a second PC. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the Google Pixelbook Go</strong>!</p>



<p>The Google Pixelbook Go is a <a href="#">beautiful package</a>, from the gorgeous 13.3 inch touchscreen display and accurate keyboard to the 12-hour battery. It costs a few hundred dollars less than our top ultrabook pick and has nearly identical specs. </p>



<p>And unlike most cheap ultrabooks, the notebook is sturdy, has a fingerprint reader, and comes with a convenient and easily replaceable USB-C charger.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>
