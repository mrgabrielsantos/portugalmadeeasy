<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably don&#8217;t give much thought to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity &#8211; just that they&#8217;re chipping away at your battery life.</p>



<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignwide is-style-default"><blockquote><p><strong>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You don&#8217;t want to overwhelm them with terrible advice. Best to keep them on track.</strong></p><cite>JOHN MCCARTHY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1-2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that&#8217;s opaque, because we can&#8217;t see it directly.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, crushing it, changing the world.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Take a social media hiatus.</strong>&nbsp;According to a recent survey from Everyday Health, 60 to 70 percent of young adults say they check their social media platforms at least daily. Why not dial that back for the holidays?</li>



<li><strong>Stick to your new routine.</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s tempting to shake up your typical schedule when the holidays come around, but women&#8217;s health expert and BINTO founder Suzie Welsh emphasizes the importance of routine amid the revelry.</li>



<li><strong>Be intentional about fitness.</strong>&nbsp;If working out is a de-stressor for you 365 days of the year, you want to make it a priority, no matter how crazy the holiday season gets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. There is always the New Project, the New Opportunity.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8388" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-150x100.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-450x300.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/18-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An awesome day for working remotely.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though Google and Facebook opened Australian offices relatively early (Google in 2003 and Facebook in 2009), they are unashamedly <a href="#">US companies</a>, obsessed with US politics. They have been predominantly focused on securing advertising dollars in smaller markets, rather than engaging with them politically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear their threats are attempts to now get the attention of Australia&#8217;s political class. And if the platforms follow through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. To be successful, follow your passion and see where it leads you. All you have to do is jump right in!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8401" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-150x100.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-450x299.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Beach resorts office might be the final destination.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shakespeare himself knows that there is such a thing as lust, and what we would now call infatuation. He&#8217;s no fool. People who exhibit the perfectionism are fearful of failure.</p>



<p>Google and Facebook were comparatively passive when the draft code first emerged in 2019, as part of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#8217;s Digital Platforms Inquiry. Providing advance notice of any changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>



<p>Success isn&#8217;t about the end result, it&#8217;s about what you learn along the way. There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the <a href="#">Critics&#8217; Choice Awards</a> and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. The contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Light comes from all sorts of randomness void.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>



<li>Smart phones are a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;energy drain.</li>



<li>Buy&nbsp;<strong>SmartMag</strong>&nbsp;for your successful site.</li>
</ul>



<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea,&nbsp;the quicker it gets executed&nbsp;and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer.&nbsp;Add your email&nbsp;address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>

<p>Even though Google and Facebook opened Australian offices relatively early (Google in 2003 and Facebook in 2009), they are unashamedly <a href="#">US companies</a>, obsessed with US politics. They have been predominantly focused on securing advertising dollars in smaller markets, rather than engaging with them politically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear their threats are attempts to now get the attention of Australia&#8217;s political class. And if the platforms follow through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. To be successful, follow your passion and see where it leads you. All you have to do is jump right in!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8401" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22.jpg 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-150x100.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-450x299.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/01/22-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Beach resorts office might be the final destination.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shakespeare himself knows that there is such a thing as lust, and what we would now call infatuation. He&#8217;s no fool. People who exhibit the perfectionism are fearful of failure.</p>



<p>Google and Facebook were comparatively passive when the draft code first emerged in 2019, as part of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#8217;s Digital Platforms Inquiry. Providing advance notice of any changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>



<p>Success isn&#8217;t about the end result, it&#8217;s about what you learn along the way. There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the <a href="#">Critics&#8217; Choice Awards</a> and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. The contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Light comes from all sorts of randomness void.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>



<li>Smart phones are a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;energy drain.</li>



<li>Buy&nbsp;<strong>SmartMag</strong>&nbsp;for your successful site.</li>
</ul>



<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea, the quicker it gets executed and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer.&nbsp;Add your email&nbsp;address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn</h3>



<p>The Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region is a magnificent area with high mountain ranges, glaciers and is actually the most glaciated part of the European Alps.</p>



<p>Visiting this area can be done relatively easy by car and if you want to go up, by train up to 3,400 metres above sea level, the highest train ride in Europe, the Jungfrau Railway is very impressive (and expensive!).</p>



<p>The area is on the UNESCO World Heritage list because of its unique and wide range of flora and fauna and geological importance regarding the creating of the High Alps.</p>

<p>Even though Google and Facebook opened Australian offices relatively early (Google in 2003 and Facebook in 2009), they are unashamedly <a href="#">US companies</a>, obsessed with US politics. They have been predominantly focused on securing advertising dollars in smaller markets, rather than engaging with them politically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear their threats are attempts to now get the attention of Australia&#8217;s political class. And if the platforms follow through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. To be successful, follow your passion and see where it leads you. All you have to do is jump right in!</h3>

<p>Google and Facebook were comparatively passive when the draft code first emerged in 2019, as part of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#8217;s Digital Platforms Inquiry. Providing advance notice of any changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>



<p>Success isn&#8217;t about the end result, it&#8217;s about what you learn along the way. There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the <a href="#">Critics&#8217; Choice Awards</a> and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. The contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Light comes from all sorts of randomness void.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>



<li>Smart phones are a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;energy drain.</li>



<li>Buy&nbsp;<strong>SmartMag</strong>&nbsp;for your successful site.</li>
</ul>



<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea, the quicker it gets executed and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer.&nbsp;Add your email&nbsp;address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for:</strong> Students, people who need only basic features, and anyone who wants a cheap laptop to use as a second PC. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the Google Pixelbook Go</strong>!</p>



<p>The Google Pixelbook Go is a <a href="#">beautiful package</a>, from the gorgeous 13.3 inch touchscreen display and accurate keyboard to the 12-hour battery. It costs a few hundred dollars less than our top ultrabook pick and has nearly identical specs. </p>



<p>And unlike most cheap ultrabooks, the notebook is sturdy, has a fingerprint reader, and comes with a convenient and easily replaceable USB-C charger.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>

<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>



<p><strong>Why we liked the 16-inch Model:</strong></p>



<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches. But the Air&#8217;s light weight, solid construction, and industry-trailing support make it a decent laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re tapping, scrolling, and swiping on your phone, you probably don&#8217;t give much thought to the fact that your apps are consuming electricity &#8211; just that they&#8217;re chipping away at your battery life.</p>



<p>Before you click away, disappointed that I brought up something as practical and boring as time management, hear me out. My intent is not to crush your spirits.</p>

<p>The average U.S. iPhone owner uses 1-2 gigabytes of LTE data per month, according to some studies. That data comes at an energy cost that&#8217;s opaque, because we can&#8217;t see it directly.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t look to your peers in the industry, because all they&#8217;re going to tell you is that they are killing it, crushing it, changing the world.</p>

<li><strong>Take a social media hiatus.</strong>&nbsp;According to a recent survey from Everyday Health, 60 to 70 percent of young adults say they check their social media platforms at least daily. Why not dial that back for the holidays?</li>



<li><strong>Stick to your new routine.</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s tempting to shake up your typical schedule when the holidays come around, but women&#8217;s health expert and BINTO founder Suzie Welsh emphasizes the importance of routine amid the revelry.</li>



<li><strong>Be intentional about fitness.</strong>&nbsp;If working out is a de-stressor for you 365 days of the year, you want to make it a priority, no matter how crazy the holiday season gets.</li>

<p><strong>Who these are for: </strong>If you prefer macOS or need limited tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet. The 16-inch models usually offer the best performance of size, weight, and speed. They&#8217;re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. </p>

<p>The 2021 MacBook Air uses an Apple M1 chip that delivers <a href="#">great performance</a> and fantastic battery life. And the keyboard is finally improved with the new switches.

<p>Even though Google and Facebook opened Australian offices relatively early (Google in 2003 and Facebook in 2009), they are unashamedly <a href="#">US companies</a>, obsessed with US politics. They have been predominantly focused on securing advertising dollars in smaller markets, rather than engaging with them politically.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear their threats are attempts to now get the attention of Australia&#8217;s political class. And if the platforms follow through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. To be successful, follow your passion and see where it leads you. All you have to do is jump right in!</h3>

<p>Shakespeare himself knows that there is such a thing as lust, and what we would now call infatuation. He&#8217;s no fool. People who exhibit the perfectionism are fearful of failure.</p>



<p>Google and Facebook were comparatively passive when the draft code first emerged in 2019, as part of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#8217;s Digital Platforms Inquiry. Providing advance notice of any changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>



<p>Success isn&#8217;t about the end result, it&#8217;s about what you learn along the way. There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the <a href="#">Critics&#8217; Choice Awards</a> and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. The contrast in these stories help to highlight what we&#8217;ve learned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Light comes from all sorts of randomness void.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>



<li>Smart phones are a&nbsp;<em>massive</em>&nbsp;energy drain.</li>



<li>Buy&nbsp;<strong>SmartMag</strong>&nbsp;for your successful site.</li>
</ul>



<p>The more lightweight you keep an idea, the quicker it gets executed and the faster you get a feel for whether or not you should continue down the same road.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d love to show you how to make a great living as a writer.&nbsp;Add your email&nbsp;address to the waitlist below to be the first to hear when we reopen the doors to new students.</p>
